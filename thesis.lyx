Instead of the traditional information blackout, we face an information
 blizzard—a whiteout.
 This forces the individual to depend on an authority to help prioritize
 the information to be selected.
 This is the foundation for the information catastrophe, an endless recycling
 of sovereignty back to the state under the pretense of informational freedom.

No matter what form it may finally have it must begin with an idea.
 It is the process of conception and realization with which the artist is
 concerned.
 Once given physical reality by the artist the work is open to the perception
 of all, including the artist.
 (I use the word perception to mean the apprehension of the sense data,
 the objective understanding of the idea, and simultaneously a subjective
 interpretation of both).
 The work of art can be perceived only after it is completed.

If there is not an accumulation of experience for animals, in that the species
 do not inherit the experience of the individuals of which they are composed,
 it is on the contrary the possibility of transmitting individual experience
 that makes possible the process of exteriorization.
 And this is what we call culture.

The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag
 in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of
 devices for their use.
 Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality
 of systems of indexing.
 When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically
 or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down
 from subclass to subclass.
 It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have
 rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome.
 Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and
 re-enter on a new path.
 The human mind does not work that way.
 It operates by association.

In evaluating systems the artist is a perpectivist considering goals, boundaries
, structure, input, output, and relate4d activity inside and outside the
 system.
 Where the object almost always has a fixed shape and boundaries, the consistenc
y of a system may be altered in time and space, its behavior determined
 both by external conditions and its mechanisms of control (Jack Burnham:

The regulability described in the first theme depends on the code described
 in the second.
 Some architectures of cyberspace are more regulable than others; some architect

 Therefore, whether a part of cyberspace—or the Internet generally—can be
 regulated turns on the nature ofits code .Its architecture will affect whether
 behavior can be controlled.
 To follow Mitch Kapor, its architecture is its politics.[2]

Library of Babel.
 Search engines a necessity.
 So much data.
 Must rank.
 Page quote - not to find the best.
 But unlike the Library of Babel, the Web is continuously growing, which
 means its catalogue must also continuously grow.
 And it is because of this that search engines become a necessary evil.
 And this sets the context for Page's quote
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In his short story The Library of Babel, Jorge Luis Borges presents us with
 an enormous series of interconnected rooms housing every possible 410-page
 book which could ever be written, in any and every language.
 Due to the algorithm by which they were constructed, most of the books
 here are nonsensical.
 However, because the library contains every conceivable book that could
 ever be written, it also houses all of the valuable information in the
 world.
 This information is technically within our reach, but attaining ultimate
 knowledge is impossible to accomplish within one’s lifetime because we
 are limited by what we randomly pull of the shelves – the library does
 not provide us with the ability to effectively search all of its contents.
 Perhaps I should use the term filter rather than search.
 Search implies that something has to be found, yet in this case we know
 where everything is, we just don’t have a mechanism of filtering out the
 useful information from the overabundance of data.
 (CAE's concept of a

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Web has a plethora of information – much of it spam, unusable, inaccurate,
 much like the majority of the books in the Library of Babel.
 Our entry point to the Web is a search engine – a piece of software which
 filters through its database to send us links to pages on the Internet
 which are “relevant” to a term we queried for.
 Like the librarian, the search engine is not very good at understanding
 concepts despite knowing the contents of each web page very well.
 However, unlike the librarian, when the search engine gives us unwanted
 instructions for staging a coup, we cannot ask the search engine why it
 thinks we want to overthrow the government (we could ask the librarian
 although who knows what the answer would be.)

Library - freedom to explore and roam.
 Find information you're looking for, but also information you weren't necessari
ly looking for.
 Personalization is black-boxed algorithms, built by privatized companies.
 Access to information is not the physical ability to acquire information,
 but the ability to explore and find new information.
 These software algorithms in essence are limiting the information you are
 exposed to online.

In his short story

Much like the Borges' Library, the World Wide Web is an enormous collection
 of independent documents containing all types of information - some useful,
 most not so much.
 With such an overabundance of data, we need a guide.
 "If Herbert Simon was right in 1971 when he dclared attention a scarce
 resource consumed by an overabundance of information, we have to recognize
 that ranking is not only very useful but also inevitable...
 Any system of ranking will favor certain sites over others; the question
 is which ones."

Nobody owns the web, yet is inherently a privatized public space.
 Public in the sense that the majority of sites do not have barriers to
 entry (such as subscription-based sites) yet it will always be privatized
 because the only way to reach these sites is to go through a private company
 at some point in the process .
 True public space, however, is incredibly important to democratic ideals
 and “the privatization of public space undermines the opportunities for
 free speech… Free speech is crucial because it … makes it possible for
 citizens to reach informed decisions about public policy [, and gives the
 minority] the opportunity to convince members of the majority of its dissenting
 views and build a coalition in favor of change.” In other words, as long
 as the Internet remains privatized, the policies governing the public spaces
 (such as search algorithms) will remain hidden, and largely unaffected
 by the uninformed dissenters.
 The existence of an accessible public space for discourse is critical to
 the survival of democratic values.
 “The media… are what always prevents response, making all processes of
 exchange impossible… This is the real abstraction of the media.
 And the system of social control and power is rooted in it.”

“Egypt” – one was shown news articles relating to the uprisings, the other

 This is a very clear example of how content filtering, under the guise
 of “personalization” can be extremely dangerous in the sense that it can
 skew individual understanding and perceptions of the world through omission
 or overvaluation of information.

 tracking individual behavior in order to personalize the web (and to serve
 hyper-targeted advertisements.) Google Views & Everybody’s Google attempt
 give power of personalization back to the user, and to create a story of
 the various life-worlds Google presents through its personalization algorithms.
 Personalization algorithms are important not just because of the curated

 In essence, CAPTCHAs demonstrate the human intervention and cultural knowldge
 required to decipher signs of written language.
 By placing physical CAPTCHAs on walls heavily covered by graﬃti tags, Barthol
 is making a connection from the process of deciphering and interpretation
 of digital signs to the signs used in graﬃti culture.
 A graﬃti tag is a sign for tagger as well a a representation of the tagging
 process itself.
 Similarly, CAPTCHAs signify not so much the underlying meaning of the word
 depicted, but rather the processes of scanning, distorting, and deciphering.

 Google tracks users as they navigate the web, making judgements and assumptions
 based not just on user-supplied information, but moreso by analyzing user
 behaviours online.

 software is used to "read" and convert the scanned pages from images to
 machine-encoded text, making it machine-searchable and indexable in the
 process.
 However, the OCR algorithms occasionally fail due to scan irregularities,
 low print quality, or similar problems.
 When this happens, the only way to decipher these portions of the digital
 scan is with a human eye.
 Thus, Google's goal of digitizing every book in existence requires an enormous
 amount of human labour.
 reCAPTCHA, the most popular CAPTCHA service on the Internet, fulfills this
 need by distributing this labour as micro-tasks across the Internet.
 In exchange for access to enhanced functionality, web users provide the
 (free) labour required to translate that which computers cannot.

A CAPTCHA consists of two text-based images: a word which could not be deciphere

 software could decipher (the "known" word.) The user is then prompted to
 type in both words, with the assumption being that if the known word is
 correctly identified, then the identification of the unknown word is also
 likely to be correct

My primary medium as an artist is software.
 However, I'd also say that I often use the Internet as a medium as well,
 not simply in the sense that much of my work is encountered online, but

 Much of my work focuses conceptually on various aspects of Internet behaviour,
 communication, and surveillance.
 Questions arises when considering exhibition of such pieces, especially
 within the context of an MFA program.
 Why not show the software itself at the MFA show? Or if it's on the Web,
 why not allow visitors to interact with the websites? I have two large

 Software is a difficult thing to present in an (traditionally) aesthetically

 Although I have primarily produced software for these projects, code is

 I'm more concerned with processes and systems than I am with objects, but
 social constructs inform us to focus on the object of contemplation when

As digital technologies become increasingly ubiquitous and accessible, digital

 While the Internet is largely viewed as embracing democratic ideals and
 guaranteeing equal access for all, to all, the fact that our Internet experienc
e is mediated almost exclusively through privatized companies, is inherently
 undemocratic.
 In order to provide "relevant" information to individual users (and increase
 revenues), companies like Google and Amazon filter content and information
 through black box algorithms.
 End users have little to no control over which items or information are
 shown to them, or in what order; and because these algorithms are trade
 secrets, users also cannot have an understanding of the filtering and selection
 process.

At the MFA show, visitors could watch the visualization of these searches
 happening in real time.
 There were users queuing search queries who were not at the show (as mentioned

 also interact with the piece provided they had a smart phone.
 Using the smart phone, they could visit

 and add items to the search queue and see their results within a few minutes
 (after all of the queries had been processed.) It was important for me to
 not introduce a keyboard and mouse interface for this piece.
 With that setup I believe it becomes very difficult for more than one person
 to engage with the piece at a time.
 In this situation, nobody is in a position to

 People are in charge of their own experience - whether that consists of
 walking past, stopping and viewing the piece for a bit, or interacting
 with it via cell phone.
 I believe this kept the focus of the piece on the content, as opposed to
 the interaction (or lack thereof.) By presenting the process as relatively
 straightforward data visualization, there wasn't much

 of a large building or landscape; a smell or a taste; a temperature and
 humidity (touch)...
 We can digitally reproduce the visual and the aural fairly well though.
 What does this do to society and the things we value? As we become more
 familiar with the visual culture and more adept and refined, do we ignore
 the other senses? As we are inundated with a certain cultural canon or
 trope, do we ignore or reject the unfamiliar? How are our tastes and our
 cultural (directions, milieu) being defined by the capabilities of computers

I presented three projects under the umbrella of the Ocular Character Recognitio

 These were largely experiments with materiality and exploring how we engage
 with the digital and the process of taking a digital artifact and presenting
 it in a physical form.
 A CAPTCHA is something one rarely - if ever - encounters outside of a computer
 screen.
 While all of the pieces were generated and created through custom software,
 no software or computers were on display or shown as a part of the MFA

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(what ideas is it exploring? what theoretical vocabularies is it engaging?
 intellectual and artistic traditions is it expanding?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The title Ocular Character Recognition is a play on the term Optical Character
 Recognition, which is the software used to convert scans or images of text
 into machine-readable documents.
 At its core, the process consists of recognizing glyphs within the pixels
 of an image and adding additional layers of metadata to that file in order
 to allow it to be searched and indexed.
 This is what adds the simple functionality of being able to select text
 from a scanned PDF.
 As opposed to an optical process - one which deals primarily with light
 and its properties - an ocular process implies an emphasis on the human
 eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are difficulties in the OCR process.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It has been mentioned that web pages are in fact created for human consumption.
 However, the web pages we view and read are simply visual representations
 of the underlying code.
 The CAPTCHA-fication process is not simply replacing text with images on
 a web page, it fundamentally changes the underlying markup of the HTML
 pages in a way such that the code itself is unreadable, as well as the
 visual representation, which can no longer be deciphered by OCR processes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From this point on, any links they click on the page will continue to be
 CAPTCHA-fied by the web server.
 However, as mentioned earlier in this paper, I have a strong aversion to
 showing digital works on a computer in a gallery setting.
 For this reason, I used the software & website developed for Webpages for
 Humans to create a series of digital prints using screenshots from the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Human Web.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The installation for Webpages for Humans consisted of a series of 5 digital
 prints suspended from the ceiling.
 These prints were generated by replacing the text on webpages with CAPTCHAs,
 transforming a digital document specifically designed for machine readability
 into a physical document which can no longer be "read" by a computer.

 white acrylic.
 The familiar images had something slightly askew (the CAPTCHA-fied text)
 and their shape and size resembled that of a laptop screen, yet without
 the rest of the laptop.
 While it was a struggle to properly light the pieces due to the location
 (in a long hallway, the opposite wall being floor-to-ceiling windows),
 at night, with controlled lighting, the white acrylic backing would catch
 and diffuse the light, causing the floating non-screens to emanate a glow.
 The luminescence of the images under proper lighting conditions reinforced
 the connection to the screen.

A CAPTCHA is something most Internet users have encountered, yet few know
 why they appear, and even fewer know how the process is connected to the

 However, based upon my interactions with students who visited the show,
 a much higher proportion of them did know quite a bit more about the process.
 The goal for this project is not necessarily to educate or raise awareness
 about reCAPTCHA, but to get people thinking on a larger scale about how
 we digitize physical objects.
 What is the process of taking a scanned copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderlan

 after Google searching for a quote from the book? By making a

 both humans and computer algorithms)?

Interaction with the pieces at the show was less than I had hoped.
 A few people interacted with Everybody's Google, but far less than I had

 Part of this may be due to the fact that cell phone reception was not very

 it being inaccessible from cruznet (the standard university wifi) due to
 the website running on a

CAPTCHA-fy! and the Serendipity Engine received mixed responses.
 Because of the limited available space in the printer mechanism and the
 long duration of the show, the Serendipity Engine only dispensed paper
 roughly ever 8 minutes.
 Nobody was in the area for that duration of time, so it was in fact extremely
 serendipitous when a sheet fell from the ceiling and

 The

 which it was installed over did not have much going on visually, and was
 largely ignored.
 The pages from the Serendipity Engine did accumulate on the floor, but
 people tended to either ignore them, or thought that they had been knocked
 over, and stacked them together into a neat pile on top of the CAPTCHA-fy!
 booklets.
 This created two problems: first, the next time a page fell unnoticed to
 the ground, the next visitor would pick it up and place it on the now-stacked
 pile of previous pages; second, the pile was placed on the footstool, on
 top of the CAPTCHA-fy! booklets, essentially rendering them invisible.
 There were a series of booklets along the window sill, but without the

The pages from the Serendipity Engine and the CAPTCHA-fy! booklets were
 intended to be takeaways.
 From my estimates, slightly more than half of the booklets were taken,
 and slightly less than half of the Serendipity Engine pages were taken
 (or possibly thrown away.)

While documenting, we timed the printer to dispense paper as people were
 walking by using a remote control and got great reactions.
 But again, it quickly devolved into people waving their hands at the ceiling,
 expecting a reaction from the magical printer in the ceiling.
 From this, I think it would've been important to have the piece be much
 more impactful rather than stressing its subtlety.
 People rarely noticed it - it may have been better to have it run for 10
 or 15 seconds straight over the course of an hour or so.
 Another option could have been to use a scroll as opposed to individual
 sheets to stress the intentionality of the piece.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Internet is largely viewed as embracing democratic ideals and
 guaranteeing equal access for all, to all, the fact that our Internet experienc
e is mediated almost exclusively through privatized companies, is inherently
 undemocratic.
 In order to provide "relevant" information to individual users (and increase
 revenues), companies like Google and Amazon filter content and information
 through black box algorithms.
 End users have little to no control over which items or information are
 shown to them, or in what order; and because these algorithms are trade
 secrets, users also cannot have an understanding of the filtering and selection
 process.
 "Personalization renders search engines practically immune to systematic
 critical evaluation because it is becoming unclear whether the (dis)appearance
 of a source is a feature (personalization done right) or a bug (censorship
 or manipulation.)"

Google plays the primary role in revealing/concealing the possibilities
 of the Internet.
 And if Google is our gateway to the world of the Internet, it’s laws and
 rules influence how we can interact with the Internet – it directly shapes
 our understanding of the space of the Internet.
 Yet with the understanding that Google search algorithms are software,
 these rules and laws it imposes are nothing other than political.
 To quote Lawrence Lessig regarding software design,

The Web 2.0 discourse provides an answer [to the question of how we can imgine
 governance of very large groups without mediat]: instead of slow and intranspar
ent institutions we no have software that allows us to scaled the community
 ideal tot the level of societ; the resulting transfer of power tot he companies
 providitg these tools - which thereby become social institutions themselves
 - is rarely addressed.

The Internet...
 is the first modern communications medium that expands its reach by decentraliz
ing the capital structure of production and distribution of information,
 culture, and knowledge...
 This basic change in the material conditions of information and cultural
 production and distribution have substantial effects on how we come to
 know the world we occupy and the alternative courses of action open to
 us as individuals and as social actors.
 Through these effects, the emerging networked environment structures how
 we perceive and pursue core values in modern liberal societies.

The media that carry segmented marketing messages, just like the ones that
 carry mass marketing messages, and even the marketing messages themselves,
 are socialization agents.
 Values, attitudes and lifestyles are learned from the content of communications
 media, whether those media are mass media or not...
 This means that the demassification of society may actually be a powerful
 reinforcement of social stratifications that could be hereditary and, because
 they would work through individual motivation, self-enforcing.

Why Google?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Code is law.
 If Google is our gateway to the world of the Internet, it’s laws and rules
 influence how we can interact with the Internet – it directly shapes our
 understanding of the space of the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is no “public space” on the Internet – everything is privatized public
 space.
 On the Internet, the gatekeepers of information are search engines, the
 most prominent being Google (as of July, 2011, Google was responsible for
 ~65% of all web searches – over 4x more than its nearest competitor.) However,
 search engines exploit the bidirectional communication inherent in web
 browsing to silently capture vast amounts of personal data and behavioral
 information from Internet users in order to “personalize” their web browsing
 experience.
 This personalization, in combination with the “black-boxed” ranking algorithms
 employed by these software systems have the ability to radically the informatio
n we encounter on the Internet.
 If we experience and know the world through our bodies, blah blah blah
 through Google.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
What is Google?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(search, gmail, ads, analytics, Google+) - they are everywhere.
 If a site has these installed, your are actually sending data to Google
 which they use to tune and train their algorithms.
 This is how they make money.

, Google first takes everything it knows about me (and everything it

 it knows about me) and uses this information to further refine its search
 results.
 And Google knows a lot about me.
 Some of the information I have explicitly given to Google while signing
 up for their services, such as my age & gender.
 But other information, Google has inferred by monitoring my browsing behaviour
 and making certain assumptions based upon how I access the internet (my
 geographic location, ISP, browser type.) They can tell if I've been waking
 up early on a regular basis and doing a lot of searches for gyms in my
 area - maybe I'm becoming more concerned about my health or getting into
 shape.
 It's safe to assume that Google has access to this information any time
 we preform a search, but Google also has access to our browsing behaviours
 across a large portion of the Internet, by providing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 analytics and advertising services to website owners.
 The website owners install these scripts inside of the HTML markup, and
 they get free ads and analytics software from Google.
 In exchange, Google gets access to the website users.
 And it can track individuals from page to page in order to create a more
 complex model of each Google user.

Search personalization - Google is presenting a different view of the world
 to each individual user.
 This is used by *lots* of websites - Amazon markets specific items to users
 based upon voluntarily contributed demographic information (age, gender,
 location), but also infers much through users' behavoiurs.
 So, if you look at a lot of juicers, Amazon will make recommendations to
 you based on the assumption that you like making your own juice for various
 reasons - this then flows into other areas: books about juicing, seeds/gardenin
g products, health equipment, etc.
 Clearly, Amazon is trying to maximize its conversion rate, and sell as
 many products as possible.
 This is how they make money - each sale generates revenue for the company.
 Their product is sales.

 the same search request.

As digital technologies become increasingly ubiquitous and accessible, digital
 resources are quickly becoming the primary resources for information and
 knowledge gathering.
 While the Internet is largely viewed as embracing democratic ideals and
 guaranteeing equal access for all, to all, the fact that our Internet experienc
e is mediated almost exclusively through privatized companies, is inherently
 undemocratic.
 In order to provide "relevant" information to individual users (and increase
 revenues), companies like Google and Amazon filter content and information
 through black box algorithms.
 End users have little to no control over which items or information are
 shown to them, or in what order; and because these algorithms are trade
 secrets, users also cannot have an understanding of the filtering and selection
 process.

Difference between web pages & traditional resources (TV, newspaper, magazine,
 radio) is that the web is always there, always available, yet is always
 changing.
 It is accessible, static, and yet extremely dynamic at the same time.
 Instead of merely consuming culture (TV, radio, film) we are now producing
 culture as well, thanks to the elimination of space-time made possible
 by high speed internet and wide accessibility to the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The digital and the physical are inherently intertwined.
 The digital largely consists of representations of physical objects, such
 as photographs, 3d models or environments, textbooks or journals.
 And the digital is only accessible through physical objects such as computers.
 And the Internet does not exist in some void - it is a massive infrastructure
 of wires, switches, and servers.

Webpages for Humans questions our notion of archiving and digital culture.
 Physical objects -> digital representations -> ? What happens to the digital
 representations.
 People forget about the physicality of the digital - web sites and data
 are transmitted over cables, applications are run from servers in warehouses
 full of servers (data farms.) When power goes down in silicon valley or
 a bomb is detonated at a server farm, what happens to not just our data,
 but our lives? As we come to live and experience more through the digital,
 having a single point of failure can drastically change blah blah blah.
 As we forget about the physical or replace/supplant it with digital representat
ions, how do we prepare for the inevitable evolution (of technology mediated
 communication) or disappearance of the current digital form?

The Bible is by far the most-read book in the world.
 When searching for eBook versions of the bible, the three main resources
 for eBooks produce very different results, based upon price, and version
 of the bible: Project Gutenberg returns the King James Version as the top
 hit, Amazon returns the English Standard Version, and Google Play returns
 a different publisher's ESV.
 (Note, these are all free versions of the books as well - prices range
 from $1 - $10 for other digital copies of the Bible.) So why is this important?
 Not necessarily because books are dead and will be replaced by iPads and
 Kindles anytime soon (especially in the context of Churches AND especially
 given navigation difficulties in digital books as large as the Bible),
 but for people researching Biblical stories, these may likely be a highly
 valuable resource.
 But more importantly, these eBooks are the digital versions of the physical
 books.
 And this means they are being indexed, searched, and analyzed by various
 software services (search, language analysis/machine learning, sentiment
 analysis, etc.) Project Gutenberg makes the content available much more
 easily for machine consumption, and is much more easily accessible for
 humans as well.

Search & Algorithms

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Search engines are software.
 Their main algorithm is a function which filters information from a database.
 In Lev Manovich’s terms, the search engine is the narrative (the algorithm)
 through which we experience the world of the Internet (the database.) It
 is this algorithm which decides whether we are a radical anarchist, scholarly
 researcher, or a promising political candidate.
 But search engines are privatized so we cannot see the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Search engines constitute a powerful source of access and accessibility
 within the Web.
 [Previous research has shown] how access to the Web is preconfigured in
 subtle but politically important ways, resulting in exclusion of significant
 voices… The politics of search engines thus represents the broader struggle
 to sustain the democratic potential of traditional media, the Internet,
 and the World Wide Web in particular.

Rationale (from original proposal)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I’m interested in exploring issues of transparency, autonomy, and agency
 with regards to technology, speciﬁcally the Internet or networked devices.
 As the power, aﬀordability, and ubiquity of digital technologies exponentially
 increases, so does the necessity to study the cultural impact of these
 systems.
 While most think of these technologies as things, I view them primarily
 as software and software systems.
 Without hardware to run on, software as we know it would not exist; yet
 without software, hardware (and the infrastructures required to build and
 run them) would be useless.
 We only experience the digital through software.
 While there are systems of policies, guidelines, and reviews of hardware
 technologies and infrastructures, only recently have software algorithms
 been seriously called into question, primarily due to monopolistic practices
 and unfair market inﬂuence[6].

The work for my MFA project largely focuses around Google, primarily because
 it is such a large part of my own personal Internet experience.
 I’m constantly connected to my Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Search not

 I also route all of my phone calls through Google voice.
 I love the services Google provides, but sometimes it feels like Google

For a while now, Google has been a target of privacy advocate, scholars,
 and artists.
 At Transmediale 2010, F.A.T.
 lab initiated FuckGoogle, “a collection of 8 http://www.jasonmorrison.net/iakm/ci
ted/Bar-Ilan_Judit_comparing_rankings.pdf 5rowser add-ons, open source software,
 theoretical musings and direct actions aimed at creating an awareness of
 the role Google plays in our daily lives.” 9 .
 One of the notable projects to come out of this eﬀort was Jamie Wilkinson’s
 Google Alarm extension for Firefox 10 .
 Whenever personal information is sent to Google servers through tracking
 cookies, an alarm horn sound clip is played over the user’s computer speakers,
 transforming a normally silent intrusion of privacy into an extremely visceral
 and prominent event.
 The project also elucidates the omni-presence of Google - Google is constantly
 tracking individual behavior in order to personalize the web (and to serve
 hyper-targeted advertisements.) Google Views & Everybody’s Google attempt
 give power of personalization back to the user, and to create a story of
 the various life-worlds Google presents through its personalization algorithms.
 Personalization algorithms are important not just because of the curated
 information they present, but also because of the information which they
 omit.

Another related project is Newstweek 11 by Julian Oliver and Danja Vasiliev.
 Newstweek is a device which hijacks “Free WiFi” Hotspots by posing as the
 Hotspot’s router.
 It then allows the Newstweek administrator to transparently manipulate
 web page content from news sites before they reach a user’s web browser.
 While the target of these subversive attacks is news media rather than
 software algorithms, the project clearly demonstrates the necessity to
 just question the content itself or its sources, but also how it gets to
 your screen.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
With regards to the “performance” aspect of Everybody’s Google (users becoming
 actors in the story), there are two online pieces which I am reminded of:
 I’m Here and There 12 by Jonas Lund and KeyTweeter 13 by Kyle McDonald.
 Both of these break down the barrier between the private space of one’s
 home or oﬃce and the public space of the Internet by posting personal user
 interactions or activities directly to the web in real time.
 This creates a transparency of computer use, but also blurs the lines between
 public/private and real/virtual.

Web Pages for Humans addresses the codiﬁcation of culture.
 reCAPTCHA is a project (now run by Google) used to help “digitize” books,
 newspapers, and documents by exploiting human labour to decipher words
 which OCR algorithms are unable of “understanding.” These cultural artifacts
 are thus transformed into machine-readable ﬁles.
 Web Pages for Humans ﬂips this model around, taking machine-generated,
 machine-readable documents and manipulating them with the CAPTCHA distortion
 algorithms to ensure that computers can no longer read their own content.
 Taken a step further, the physical prints of Search Stories for Humans
 remove the digital representation, creating a format that can truly only
 be read by humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Aram Barthol did something related with his project Are you Human? 14 In
 essence, CAPTCHAs demonstrate the human intervention and cultural knowldge
 required to decipher signs of written language.
 By placing physical CAPTCHAs on walls heavily covered by graﬃti tags, Barthol
 is making a connection from the process of deciphering and interpretation
 of digital signs to the signs used in graﬃti culture.
 A graﬃti tag is a sign for tagger as well a a representation of the tagging
 process itself.
 Similarly, CAPTCHAs signify not so much the underlying meaning of the word
 depicted, but rather the processes of scanning, distorting, and deciphering.

Finally, Bicycle Built for Two Thousand 15 by Aaron Koblin and Daniel Massey
 is a great example of reintroducing the human element back into a computer’s
 representation culture.
 Users of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk recorded their interpretations sound
 clips from computer singing “Daisy Bell” (the ﬁrst song ever sung by a
 computer.) These samples were then combined together to reproduce the original
 track using human voices as opposed to computersynthesized sounds creating
 a human-ized version of a digital artifact.

\begin_layout Enumerate
These projects deal with the internet.
 The internet is the content, and the internet is the medium.
 They take their form as websites, and equally important is the mindset
 in which someone encounters them.
 Ideally, a person encountering these projects would be coming from a google
 search, or perhaps had just filled out a CAPTCHA shortly beforehand.
 They are not meant to be contemplated or taken in isolation, they are meant
 to be integrated into/encountered during one's own (personal) internet
 experience.
