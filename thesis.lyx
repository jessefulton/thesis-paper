When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning
 and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair.
 The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.

The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.
 This kind of art is not theoretical or illustrative of theories; it is
 intuitive, it is involved with all types of mental processes and it is
 purposeless.
 It is usually free from the dependence on the skill of the artist as a
 craftsman.
 It is the objective of the artist who is concerned with conceptual art
 to make his work mentally interesting to the spectator, and therefore usually
 he would want it to become emotionally dry.

No matter what form it may finally have it must begin with an idea.
 It is the process of conception and realization with which the artist is
 concerned.
 Once given physical reality by the artist the work is open to the perception
 of al, including the artist.
 (I use the word perception to mean the apprehension of the sense data,
 the objective understanding of the idea, and simultaneously a subjective
 interpretation of both).
 The work of art can be perceived only after it is completed.

“Library science scholars in particular concern themselves with the changing
 locus of access to information and knowledge (from public shelves and stacks
 to commercial servers).
 The ‘Google effect’ also may be couched in terms of supplanting surfing

 It also may be studied in terms of the demise of the expert editor, and
 the rise of the back-end algorithm.” (Rogers, 7) “The issue no longer is
 how much of society and culture is online, but rather how to diagnose cultural
 change and societal conditions using the Internet.
 The conceptual point of departure for the research program is the recognition
 that the Internet is not only an object of study, but also a source.” (Rogers

Speed destroys space, it erases temporal distance.

 The more memory we store on data banks, the more the past is sucked into
 the orbit of the present, ready to be called up on the screen.
 A sense of historical contiuityor, for that matter, discontinuity, both

If there is not an accumulation of experience for animals, in that the species
 do not inherit the experience of the individuals of which they are composed,
 it is on the contrary the possibility of transmitting individual experience

In evaluating systems the artist is a perpectivist considering goals, boundaries
, structure, input, output, and relate4d activity inside and outside the
 system.
 Where the object almost always has a fixed shape and boundaries, the consistenc

Some architectures of cyberspace are more regulable than others; some architectu

 Therefore, whether a part of cyberspace—or the Internet generally—can be
 regulated turns on the nature of its code.
 Its architecture will affect whether behavior can be controlled.
 To follow Mitch Kapor, its architecture is its politics.

 Ocular Character Recognition investigates how we interact with and archive

\begin_layout Standard
As technology becomes more accessible and more ubiquitous, websites and
 software applications are becoming a primary resource for personal development.
 I am interested in the societal impact of these large-scale information-based
 software systems, and specifically how they influence human knowledge (research
; information retrieval; learning) and culture (preserving culture; creating/inf

Everybody's Google focuses on Google's search personalization algorithms.
 Google is profitable as a business because it makes money serving highly
 personalized advertisements.
 Google tracks users as they navigate the web, making judgements and assumptions
 based not just on user-supplied information, but moreso by analyzing users
 behaviours online.
 The sites you visit, the things you search for, the time of day and from
 where you search - all of this information is pooled by Google and assembled
 into a model in order to serve the most relevant advertisements to you.
 However, this same information is also used to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

improve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Google search results by filtering out any results which Google's algorithms
 deem irrelevant for you, and artificially inflating the scores for pages
 which it believes you might be interested in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Internet is largely viewed as embracing democratic ideals and
 guaranteeing equal access for all, to all, the fact that our Internet experienc
e is mediated almost exclusively through privatized companies, is inherently
 undemocratic.
 In order to provide "relevant" information to individual users (and increase
 revenues), companies like Google and Amazon filter content and information
 through black box algorithms.
 End users have little to no control over which items or information are
 shown to them, or in what order; and because these algorithms are trade
 secrets, users also cannot have an understanding of the filtering and selection
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ocular Character Recognition was created as a response to frustration with
 CAPTCHA tests generated by Google's reCAPTCHA service.
 CAPTCHAs are the images of distorted text you must translate to do things
 like sign up for an account on a website or post a comment in an Internet
 forum.
 They're used to prevent spam by determining if the user of a site is a
 human, or a computer program (often referred to as a "bot.")

A CAPTCHA test generally consists of two text-based images: a word which
 could not be deciphered by OCR software (the "unknown" word); and a second
 word which the OCR software could decipher (the "known" word.) The user
 is then prompted to type in both words, with the assumption being that
 if the known word is correctly identified, then the identification of the
 unknown word is also likely to be correct

 This human translation for the unknown word is then added to the original
 OCR translation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Google digitizes physical books (as part of its Google Books project),
 OCR software is used to "read" the scanned pages and make it searchable
 and indexable.
 However, the computer algorithms fail occasionally due to scan irregularities,
 low print quality, or similar problems.
 When this happens, the only way to decipher these portions of the digitized
 text is with a human eye.
 Google's massive attempt to digitize every book in existence requires an
 enormous amount of human labour.
 reCAPTCHA, the most popular CAPTCHA service on the Internet, fulfills this
 need by distributing this labour as micro-tasks across the Internet.
 In exchange for access to enhanced functionality, web users provide the
 labour required to translate that which computers cannot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I view these projects as experiments rather than as answers to any particular
 questions.
 They are intended to raise awareness of complex and important issues in
 an approachable and easily digestible form.
 For something that largely remains unseen, it is difficult to create a
 physical form, but the projects detailed below represent a few of the possible
 manifestations of the concepts presented within each project.

 From my viewpoint, the main projects are the ideas.
 The software I have written is the manifestation of those ideas.
 Interacting with the corresponding websites (in a non-gallery setting)
 is the experience of those ideas.
 And the pieces shown at the MFA show were a condensation of those ideas.

Why not show the software itself or the websites? Software is a difficult
 thing to present in an aesthetically pleasing and approachable way.
 Perhaps code can have an aesthetic form, however, I'm not so much concerned
 with the code or its structure as much as I am at the exploration of the
 underlying ideas and goals which the code is accomplishing.
 I'm interested in the processes the code represents.
 In that sense, although the code is the large majority of the work I have
 produced...

So, why not show the websites at the MFA show? A large problem with digital
 art is that it is often viewed as a gimmick, or merely as a technical demo.
 Rather than appreciate the work as a piece of art, it becomes a game of

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And once that puzzle has been solved, it's onto the next one.
 However, this seems to be the case only when such pieces are presented
 in the context of a museum or gallery.
 When encountered serendipitously or on one's own explorations, most people
 engage with these types of projects much differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being in a

 and being forced to interact with a piece through the interface we associate
 with work or leisure changes the essence of a web-based piece.
 If art is about the artist's intent, then placing something which was not
 created for a museum or gallery space within that context is just as absurd
 as saying that viewing a 3D model of the David inside of Google Sketchup
 is the same as viewing it through an augmented reality browser in your
 living room.
 Even if the visual representation of the David were reproduced perfectly,
 it's essence is radically different.

 I would argue that net.art and Internet-based works collapse the distinction
 between space and time, ultimately one experiences these types of works
 in a virtual space constructed within ones mind.
 In this sense, the viewer's state of mind is essential, and the cultural

 a teenage girl from Atlanta interested in fashion, celebrities, and pop
 music; a middle-aged conservative Christian businessman from rural Virginia;

 However, unlike traditional characters in a story, these personas only
 exist in code as a set of URLs.
 These characters develop as the software guides them through the web, reading
 blogs and news sites.

 them to hone and refine its idea of what these

 Rather than exploring raw data in a traditional format, visitors to the
 website may engage with the data by entering a search query which will
 then be executed by each of the 4 personas.
 Their search results are then saved and compared in a visualization.
 The data is stored in a database and visualized on the website as a series
 of rotating cubes showing each account's top 10 results for particular
 Google Search queries.
 Each cube face in the visualization represents one of four personas, each
 representing a particular stereotype: a young man living in the UK who
 is interested in sports and gambling; a teenage girl from Atlanta interested
 in fashion, celebrities, and pop music; a middle-aged conservative Christian
 businessman from rural Virginia; and a liberal, Californian mom-to-be,
 interested in women’s rights.

(audience, how do they engage?, what do they get out of it?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the MFA show, visitors could watch the visualization of these searches
 happening in real time.
 There were users queuing search queries who were not at the show (as mentioned
 above, regarding the KnowYourMeme discussion), but people at the show could
 also interact with the piece provided they had a smart phone.
 Using the smart phone, they could visit

\end_inset

 and add items to the search queue and see their results within a few minutes
 (after all of the queries had been processed.) It was important for me to
 not introduce a keyboard and mouse interface for this piece.
 With that setup I believe it becomes very difficult for more than one person
 to engage with the piece at a time.
 In this situation, nobody is in a position to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

assume control
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the piece.
 People are in charge of their own experience - whether that consists of
 walking past, stopping and viewing the piece for a bit, or interacting
 with it via cell phone.
 I believe this kept the focus of the piece on the content, as opposed to
 the interaction (or lack thereof.) By presenting the process as relatively
 straightforward data visualization, there wasn't much 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

digital magic

 to figure out.
 With the minimalist implementation, there wasn't much else to focus on.

Most web users are not aware that their Internet experience is personalized

 Even those who are aware of this do not realize to what extent it occurs.

 To get people to question their

Ocular Character Recognition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I presented three projects under the umbrella of the Ocular Character Recognitio
n project at the MFA show.
 These were largely experiments with materiality and exploring how we engage
 with the digital and the process of taking a digital artifact and presenting
 it in a physical form.
 A CAPTCHA is something one rarely - if ever - encounters outside of a computer
 screen.
 While all of the pieces were generated and created through custom software,
 no software or computers were on display or shown as a part of the MFA
 show.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ocular Character Recognition consists of three separate, but related projects:

\begin_layout Plain Layout
CAPTCHA-fy is the term I use to distort text to the point where it become

 This technique is the only reason why CAPTCHAs work.

 machine-readable HTML documents; CAPTCHA-fy! - handmade booklets expressing
 the underlying goals and ideas under the OCR umbrella (a manifesto); and
 The Serendipity Engine - a modified printer used to serendipitously dispense/pr
oduce CAPTCHA-fied pages from eBooks digitized through Google's book/library
 project.

Conceptual Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(what ideas is it exploring? what theoretical vocabularies is it engaging?
 intellectual and artistic traditions is it expanding?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The title Ocular Character Recognition is a play on the term Optical Character
 Recognition, which is the software used to convert scans or images of text
 into machine-readable documents.
 At its core, the process consists of recognizing glyphs within the pixels
 of an image and adding additional layers of metadata to that file in order
 to allow it to be searched and indexed.
 This is what adds the simple functionality of being able to select text
 from a scanned PDF.
 As opposed to an optical process - one which deals primarily with light
 and its properties - an ocular process implies an emphasis on the human
 eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are difficulties in the OCR process.
 OCR algorithms have difficulties with font changes, superscripts/subscripts,
 mathematical formulas, handwritten notes, or even full handwritten pages
 (journals, diaries, legal documents/letters)

Ocular Character Recognition tries to put the focus of digitization back
 on the human experience, and preserving human culture by reversing the
 process of digitization, defamiliarizing the familiar, and reclaiming the
 physical/claiming the digital.

It has been mentioned that web pages are in fact created for human consumption.
 However, the web pages we view and read are simply visual representations
 of the underlying code.
 The CAPTCHA-fication process is not simply replacing text with images on

 From this point on, any links they click on the page will continue to be
 CAPTCHA-fied by the web server.
 However, as mentioned earlier in this paper, I have a strong aversion to
 showing digital works on a computer in a gallery setting.
 For this reason, I used the software & website developed for Webpages for
 Humans to create a series of digital prints using screenshots from the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Human Web.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The installation for Webpages for Humans consisted of a series of 5 digital
 prints suspended from the ceiling.
 These prints were generated by replacing the text on webpages with CAPTCHAs,
 transforming a digital document specifically designed for machine readability
 into a physical document which can no longer be "read" by a computer.

, and mounted between a sheet of clear acrylic and a sheet of translucent
 white acrylic.
 The familiar images had something slightly askew (the CAPTCHA-fied text)
 and their shape and size resembled that of a laptop screen, yet without
 the rest of the laptop.
 While it was a struggle to properly light the pieces due to the location
 (in a long hallway, the opposite wall being floor-to-ceiling windows),
 at night, with controlled lighting, the white acrylic backing would catch
 and diffuse the light, causing the floating non-screens to emanate a glow.
 The luminescence of the images under proper lighting conditions reinforced
 the connection to the screen.

 Hand-bound booklets with hand-printed covers on high quality papers.
 The inner pages were low-quality xerox copies, retaining the DIY, hand-made,

 There was also a reading area consisting of two chairs and a footstool,

 There was originally a holder for the pamphlets to signal that they were

 The pamphlets were then arranged along the window behind the reading area.

A CAPTCHA is something most Internet users have encountered, yet few know
 why they appear, and even fewer know how the process is connected to the
 Google Book project.
 However, based upon my interactions with students who visited the show,
 a much higher proportion of them did know quite a bit more about the process.
 The goal for this project is not necessarily to educate or raise awareness
 about reCAPTCHA, but to get people thinking on a larger scale about how
 we digitize physical objects.
 What is the process of taking a scanned copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderlan
d and then being brought to a particular phrase in that digital representation
 after Google searching for a quote from the book? By making a

 and what it means to view a digital document.

 both humans and computer algorithms)?

 Either they

 immediately, or after I explained it, they became very intrigued.
 There seemed to be a certain level of technical proficiency associated
 with the depth at which people connected with the pieces.
 There were a number of people who were incredibly excited by the ideas
 who seemed to have a very solid understanding of how software in general
 works, despite not necessarily being programmers (most simply worked with
 software and the Internet on a daily basis.) In this sense, I believe that
 my expectations of the primary audience being

\end_layout

Interaction with the pieces at the show was less than I had hoped.
 A few people interacted with Everybody's Google, but far less than I had
 expected.
 Part of this may be due to the fact that cell phone reception was not very
 good in the building.
 I decided not to set up a separate wifi network for the project despite
 it being inaccessible from cruznet (the standard university wifi) due to
 the website running on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nonstandard,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 blocked port.
 And the wall text (for both projects) did not overly emphasize the fact
 that these were software projects living on the web.
 Even with the addition of the web page URLs on the wall text, few people
 seemed to realize that these were both products or manifestations of software/w
ebsites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CAPTCHA-fy! and the Serendipity Engine received mixed responses.
 Because of the limited available space in the printer mechanism and the
 long duration of the show, the Serendipity Engine only dispensed paper
 roughly ever 8 minutes.
 Nobody was in the area for that duration of time, so it was in fact extremely
 serendipitous when a sheet fell from the ceiling and 
\emph on
was noticed
\emph default
 by a visitor.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reading area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which it was installed over did not have much going on visually, and was
 largely ignored.
 The pages from the Serendipity Engine did accumulate on the floor, but
 people tended to either ignore them, or thought that they had been knocked
 over, and stacked them together into a neat pile on top of the CAPTCHA-fy!
 booklets.
 This created two problems: first, the next time a page fell unnoticed to
 the ground, the next visitor would pick it up and place it on the now-stacked
 pile of previous pages; second, the pile was placed on the footstool, on
 top of the CAPTCHA-fy! booklets, essentially rendering them invisible.
 There were a series of booklets along the window sill, but without the
 context of a series of 4 or 5 clearly marked as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The pages from the Serendipity Engine and the CAPTCHA-fy! booklets were

\begin_layout Standard
While documenting, we timed the printer to dispense paper as people were
 walking by using a remote control and got great reactions.
 But again, it quickly devolved into people waving their hands at the ceiling,
 expecting a reaction from the magical printer in the ceiling.
 From this, I think it would've been important to have the piece be much
 more impactful rather than stressing its subtlety.
 People rarely noticed it - it may have been better to have it run for 10
 or 15 seconds straight over the course of an hour or so.
 Another option could have been to use a scroll as opposed to individual
 sheets to stress the intentionality of the piece.

 On the Internet, the gatekeepers of information are search engines, the

 ~65% of all web searches – over 4x more than its nearest competitor.) However,
 search engines exploit the bidirectional communication inherent in web
 browsing to silently capture vast amounts of personal data and behavioral
 information from Internet users in order to “personalize” their web browsing
 experience.
 This personalization, in combination with the “black-boxed” ranking algorithms
 employed by these software systems have the ability to radically the informatio

 results.
 And Google knows a lot about me.
 Some of the information I have explicitly given to Google while signing
 up for their services, such as my age & gender.
 But other information, Google has inferred by monitoring my browsing behaviour
 and making certain assumptions based upon how I access the internet (my
 geographic location, ISP, browser type.) They can tell if I've been waking
 up early on a regular basis and doing a lot of searches for gyms in my
 area - maybe I'm becoming more concerned about my health or getting into
 shape.
 It's safe to assume that Google has access to this information any time
 we preform a search, but Google also has access to our browsing behaviours
 across a large portion of the Internet, by providing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 analytics and advertising services to website owners.
 The website owners install these scripts inside of the HTML markup, and
 they get free ads and analytics software from Google.
 In exchange, Google gets access to the website users.
 And it can track individuals from page to page in order to create a more
 complex model of each Google user.

 This is used by *lots* of websites - Amazon markets specific items to users

 So, if you look at a lot of juicers, Amazon will make recommendations to
 you based on the assumption that you like making your own juice for various
 reasons - this then flows into other areas: books about juicing, seeds/gardenin
g products, health equipment, etc.
 Clearly, Amazon is trying to maximize its conversion rate, and sell as
 many products as possible.
 This is how they make money - each sale generates revenue for the company.
 Their product is sales.

The Bible is by far the most-read book in the world.
 When searching for eBook versions of the bible, the three main resources

 a different publisher's ESV.
 (Note, these are all free versions of the books as well - prices range
 from $1 - $10 for other digital copies of the Bible.) So why is this important?
 Not necessarily because books are dead and will be replaced by iPads and
 Kindles anytime soon (especially in the context of Churches AND especially
 given navigation difficulties in digital books as large as the Bible),
 but for people researching Biblical stories, these may likely be a highly
 valuable resource.
 But more importantly, these eBooks are the digital versions of the physical
 books.
 And this means they are being indexed, searched, and analyzed by various
 software services (search, language analysis/machine learning, sentiment
 analysis, etc.) Project Gutenberg makes the content available much more
 easily for machine consumption, and is much more easily accessible for
 humans as well.
 Link analysis, weight, reputation/reliability...

 I did not use this as an example in the MFA show because I was trying to

Search & Algorithms

\begin_layout Standard
Search engines are software.
 Their main algorithm is a function which filters information from a database.
 In Lev Manovich’s terms, the search engine is the narrative (the algorithm)
 through which we experience the world of the Internet (the database.)

 It is this algorithm which decides whether we are a radical anarchist,
 scholarly researcher, or a promising political candidate.
 But search engines are privatized so we cannot see the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Search engines constitute a powerful source of access and accessibility
 within the Web.
 [Previous research has shown] how access to the Web is preconfigured in
 subtle but politically important ways, resulting in exclusion of significant
 voices… The politics of search engines thus represents the broader struggle
 to sustain the democratic potential of traditional media, the Internet,
 and the World Wide Web in particular.

 This is not my Internet, this is Google’s Internet, and therein lies one

 My experience of the Internet is filtered through privatized companies
 controlling the flow of information (search engines, ISPs, etc.) which already
 hints that the democratic potential of the World Wide Web has already been
 compromised.

Newstweek by Julian Oliver & Danja Vasiliev Newstweek is a “tactical device

Google Alarm by Jamie Wilkinson Google Alarm is a web browser extension

Rationale (from original proposal)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I’m interested in exploring issues of transparency, autonomy, and agency
 with regards to technology, speciﬁcally the Internet or networked devices.
 As the power, aﬀordability, and ubiquity of digital technologies exponentially
 increases, so does the necessity to study the cultural impact of these
 systems.
 While most think of these technologies as things, I view them primarily
 as software and software systems.
 Without hardware to run on, software as we know it would not exist; yet
 without software, hardware (and the infrastructures required to build and
 run them) would be useless.
 We only experience the digital through software.
 While there are systems of policies, guidelines, and reviews of hardware
 technologies and infrastructures, only recently have software algorithms
 been seriously called into question, primarily due to monopolistic practices
 and unfair market inﬂuence[6].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work for my MFA project largely focuses around Google, primarily because
 it is such a large part of my own personal Internet experience.
 I’m constantly connected to my Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Search not
 just on my computer, but also on my Android phone.
 I also route all of my phone calls through Google voice.
 I love the services Google provides, but sometimes it feels like Google
 knows me better than does my own mother.

\begin_layout Standard
For a while now, Google has been a target of privacy advocate, scholars,
 and artists.
 At Transmediale 2010, F.A.T.
 lab initiated FuckGoogle, “a collection of 8 http://www.jasonmorrison.net/iakm/ci
ted/Bar-Ilan_Judit_comparing_rankings.pdf 5rowser add-ons, open source software,
 theoretical musings and direct actions aimed at creating an awareness of
 the role Google plays in our daily lives.” 9 .
 One of the notable projects to come out of this eﬀort was Jamie Wilkinson’s
 Google Alarm extension for Firefox 10 .
 Whenever personal information is sent to Google servers through tracking
 cookies, an alarm horn sound clip is played over the user’s computer speakers,
 transforming a normally silent intrusion of privacy into an extremely visceral
 and prominent event.
 The project also elucidates the omni-presence of Google - Google is constantly
 tracking individual behavior in order to personalize the web (and to serve
 hyper-targeted advertisements.) Google Views & Everybody’s Google attempt
 give power of personalization back to the user, and to create a story of
 the various life-worlds Google presents through its personalization algorithms.
 Personalization algorithms are important not just because of the curated
 information they present, but also because of the information which they
 omit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another related project is Newstweek 11 by Julian Oliver and Danja Vasiliev.
 Newstweek is a device which hijacks “Free WiFi” Hotspots by posing as the
 Hotspot’s router.
 It then allows the Newstweek administrator to transparently manipulate
 web page content from news sites before they reach a user’s web browser.
 While the target of these subversive attacks is news media rather than
 software algorithms, the project clearly demonstrates the necessity to
 just question the content itself or its sources, but also how it gets to
 your screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to the “performance” aspect of Everybody’s Google (users becoming
 actors in the story), there are two online pieces which I am reminded of:
 I’m Here and There 12 by Jonas Lund and KeyTweeter 13 by Kyle McDonald.
 Both of these break down the barrier between the private space of one’s
 home or oﬃce and the public space of the Internet by posting personal user
 interactions or activities directly to the web in real time.
 This creates a transparency of computer use, but also blurs the lines between
 public/private and real/virtual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Web Pages for Humans addresses the codiﬁcation of culture.
 reCAPTCHA is a project (now run by Google) used to help “digitize” books,
 newspapers, and documents by exploiting human labour to decipher words
 which OCR algorithms are unable of “understanding.” These cultural artifacts
 are thus transformed into machine-readable ﬁles.
 Web Pages for Humans ﬂips this model around, taking machine-generated,
 machine-readable documents and manipulating them with the CAPTCHA distortion
 algorithms to ensure that computers can no longer read their own content.
 Taken a step further, the physical prints of Search Stories for Humans
 remove the digital representation, creating a format that can truly only
 be read by humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aram Barthol did something related with his project Are you Human? 14 In
 essence, CAPTCHAs demonstrate the human intervention and cultural knowldge
 required to decipher signs of written language.
 By placing physical CAPTCHAs on walls heavily covered by graﬃti tags, Barthol
 is making a connection from the process of deciphering and interpretation
 of digital signs to the signs used in graﬃti culture.
 A graﬃti tag is a sign for tagger as well a a representation of the tagging
 process itself.
 Similarly, CAPTCHAs signify not so much the underlying meaning of the word
 depicted, but rather the processes of scanning, distorting, and deciphering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, Bicycle Built for Two Thousand 15 by Aaron Koblin and Daniel Massey
 is a great example of reintroducing the human element back into a computer’s
 representation culture.
 Users of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk recorded their interpretations sound
 clips from computer singing “Daisy Bell” (the ﬁrst song ever sung by a
 computer.) These samples were then combined together to reproduce the original
 track using human voices as opposed to computersynthesized sounds creating
 a human-ized version of a digital artifact.
