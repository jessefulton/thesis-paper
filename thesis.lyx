The Web 2.0 discourse provides an answer [to the question of how we can imagine
 governance of very large groups without media]: instead of slow and intranspare
nt institutions we now have software that allows us to scaled the community
 ideal tot the level of society; the resulting transfer of power to the
 companies providing these tools - which thereby become social institutions
 themselves - is rarely addressed.

Instead of the traditional information blackout, we face an information
 blizzard—a whiteout.
 This forces the individual to depend on an authority to help prioritize
 the information to be selected.
 This is the foundation for the information catastrophe, an endless recycling
 of sovereignty back to the state under the pretense of informational freedom.

The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag
 in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of
 devices for their use.
 Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality
 of systems of indexing.
 When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically
 or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down
 from subclass to subclass.
 It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have
 rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome.
 Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and
 re-enter on a new path.
 The human mind does not work that way.
 It operates by association.

In evaluating systems the artist is a perspectivist considering goals, boundarie
s, structure, input, output, and related activity inside and outside the
 system.
 Where the object almost always has a fixed shape and boundaries, the consistenc
y of a system may be altered in time and space, its behavior determined
 both by external conditions and its mechanisms of control (Jack Burnham:

The regulability described in the first theme depends on the code described
 in the second.
 Some architectures of cyberspace are more regulable than others; some architect
ures enable better control than others.
 Therefore, whether a part of cyberspace—or the Internet generally—can be
 regulated turns on the nature ofits code .Its architecture will affect whether
 behavior can be controlled.
 To follow Mitch Kapor, its architecture is its politics.[2]

 The answer to that question is a complicated one, but for most users connected

 This process of selecting

 advertisements is executed by an algorithm ranking items based on the inferred
 user models.
 If some ads are ranked as relevant, then by definition others must be considere
d to be less relevant, or even irrelevant.
 In addition to fueling Google's AdSense platform, this is the same fundamental
 process underlying the personalization of Google search results on a user-by-us
er basis.
 The personalization process filters out results which Google's algorithms
 deem irrelevant for you based upon your user model; it also artificially
 inflates the scores for pages which it believes you might be interested
 in.
 However, in a privatized system run by a for-profit company, one must assume
 that information deemed “relevant” exists in a gray area between “important”
 and “profitable.”

End users have little to no control over how Google is evaluating reults
 for search queries.
 The items which are selected and the order in which they appear are controlled
 by algorithms, invisible to the user.
 And because they are classified as trade secrets, Google has no reason
 to disclose how they work; what information they are collecting and analyzing;
 or how certain behaviours affect Google (personalized) search rankings.
 These algorithms are executed in a black box

 In short, Google is indexing culture and then making it widely available
 through its various services.
 The algorithms running these services are not just filtering information
 or data, they're filtering culture and influencing its trajectory.
 In this sense, Google is engaged in a never-ending cycle of simultaneously
 consuming culture as well as producing it - it is the ultimate cultural
 prosumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step in making all of this possible is to index, store, and analyze
 cultural artifacts: music, films, books, museums, restaurants, opinions,
 events, etc.
 But at which point do the digital representations overtake or replace the
 originals? What are the cultural ramifications when the physical object
 is destroyed and all that remains is its digital representation? And what
 happens when the digital representation becomes corrupted, is censored,
 or is lost in a power outage or natural disaster? The more interesting
 question to me is,

As part of its digitization process, the Google Books Library Project is
 an attempt to create digital copies of every book in existence.
 When Google digitizes physical books, OCR
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Optical Character Recognition
\end_layout

\end_inset

 software is used to "read" and convert the scanned pages from images to
 machine-encoded text, creating a machine-searchable and indexable copy
 of the physical book in the process.
 However, the OCR algorithms occasionally fail due to scan irregularities,
 low print quality, or similar problems.
 When this happens, the only way to decipher these portions of the digital
 scan is with a human eye.
 Thus, Google's goal of digitizing every book in existence requires an enormous
 amount of human labour.
 reCAPTCHA, the most popular CAPTCHA service on the Internet, distributes
 this labour as micro-tasks to Web users across the Internet, using their
 eyes to decipher the pieces of scanned text which the OCR software could
 not read.
 In exchange for access to enhanced website functionality (such as the ability
 to post a comment on a blog or forum), website visitors solve CAPTCHA tests,
 providing Google with the (free) labour required to fill in the gaps in
 its OCR translations
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A CAPTCHA served from the reCAPTCHA service consists of two text-based images:
 a word which could not be deciphered by OCR software (the "unknown" word);
 and a second word which the OCR software could decipher (the "known" word.)
 The user is then prompted to type in both words, with the assumption being
 that if the known word is correctly identified, then the identification
 of the unknown word is also likely to be correct.
 This human translation for the unknown word is then added to the original
 OCR translation.

However, search engines have become much more complex since their inception.
 In order to remain competitive and profitable, they are constantly refining
 their ranking algorithms.
 One integral innovation to Google's algorithms has been search personalization.
 Google tracks user behaviours on its own sites, as well as on external
 websites through the use of various embedded widgets.
 They use this information to generate "user interest" models.
 These inferred data models are then used to personalize Google Search,
 prioritizing results which its personalization algorithms deem relevant
 to each individual user.
 In this sense, the Google algorithms are the arbiters of taste in the digital
 realm.
 They present you with the information you should be most interested in.
 Personalization creates potential for a

, allowing the company to hone and refine its idea of these users' interests.
 Google builds models of this information, using it to send targeted advertiseme

 For example, one of the accounts is constantly reading MTV hip hop blogs
 - Google is likely to assume that this person is very interested in hip
 hop music and news and will filter the results accordingly.

The specific character interests (defined by their subscribed urls) were
 intentionally chosen to get a diverse set of search results for a wide

 queries.
 Each cube in the visualization represents one item in the top 10 search
 results returned by Google; each face of each cube represents one of the
 four personas.
 As the cubes rotate and a set of cube faces becomes perpendicular with
 our field of vision, we are presented screenshots of the 10 URLs returned
 to that Google account for the current search term being visualized.

 not introduce a keyboard and mouse interface for this piece.

 to engage with the piece at a time.
 In this situation, nobody is in a position to

 the interaction (or lack thereof.) By presenting the process as relatively

Up until this point, I have largely been focused on Google's web search
 which allows users to find web pages relevant to search queries.
 But as discussed in the introduction, Google is indexing much more than
 web sites.
 We can search geographic locations and restaurant menus; we can walk through
 virtual reproductions of museums; and we can search through digital representat
ions of physical books.
 Google is making the physical world searchable through digitization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does it mean to be digitized? How does digitization change our understandin
g of the physical? While it is important to consider who is determining
 which objects are worthy of digitization, first one must ask what 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be digitized? Digitization entails more than simply capturing data or models
 of certain objects.
 It is also the ability to create a representation of that object using
 display technologies.
 The ability to be digitized depends upon a combination of the state of
 technology and the qualities of the object itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to transfer visual input to physical media has been around in
 some form for centuries, with sound recording coming more recently.
 Understandably, photos, texts, and music already have digital counterparts,
 whereas technology for recreating stimuli for tactile or olfactory senses
 is rare.
 But there are difficulties in all types of digitization processes - even
 those which lend themselves well to the current state of digital media
 (books, image scans, etc.) OCR algorithms have difficulties with font changes,
 superscripts/subscripts, mathematical formulas, handwritten notes, or even
 full handwritten pages (journals, diaries, legal documents/letters.) Issues
 also arise during the scanning process where digital artifacts can appear,
 or pages may be lost or corrupted due to aberrations in the scanning process

While it may be possible to capture information about light sources, temperature
, humidity, taste, or smell, there is currently no way to reproduce and
 present that data on a mass scale.
 On the other hand, this capability is widely accessible with regards to
 the visual and aural senses.
 It is physically impossible to create an accurate reproduction of a large
 building or landscape; a smell or a taste; a temperature and humidity (touch)...
 It is much easier to digitally reproduce and archive the visual and the
 aural.
 From a historical perspective, it makes sense that technology would continue
 to evolve in areas in which there is already a history of implementation
 and culture.
 But as we become more familiar with visual culture  and more adept and
 refined, do we ignore the other senses? As we are inundated with a certain
 cultural canon or trope, do we ignore or reject the unfamiliar? How are
 our tastes and our cultural (directions, milieu) being defined by the capabilit
ies of computers and digitization processes? If the goal is ultimately to
 preserve culture, we must go beyond the visual and the aural.

At its heart, Ocular Character Recognition is about questioning the types
 of physical data and objects which we can search for and interact with
 in digital formats.
 Some objects do not translate to a 2-dimensional, screen representation.
 Some things cannot be represented digitally, or reproduced on a screen.
 We can digitize things which appeal to our aural and visual senses, but
 it's difficult to digitize other types of cultural objects or practices.
 When we become so focused on preserving the object, what happens to the
 rest of culture which cannot be captured in the same way these artifacts
 can?

I'm very interested in how we treat physical objects differently from their
 digital representations.
 And as the physical and the virtual continue to merge together, it is interesti

 Do we treat digital content differently if it's encountered in a physical
 format? Perhaps by doing this, we can gain any insight into the processes
 and changes which occur when transplanting artifacts from the physical
 realm to the virtual, or vice versa.
 This is the driving force behind my project Ocular Character Recognition.

 By placing physical CAPTCHAs on walls heavily covered by graﬃti tags, Barthol
 is making a connection from the process of deciphering and interpretation
 of digital signs to the signs used in graﬃti culture.
 A graﬃti tag is a sign for tagger as well a a representation of the tagging
 process itself.
 Similarly, CAPTCHAs signify not so much the underlying meaning of the word

 Unbeknownst to them, most web users have not only encountered the project,
 but they have likely contributed to it as well through the usage of CAPTCHAs.
 As mentioned in the introduction to this paper, Google uses CAPTCHA tests
 to supplement the automated translations being performed as part of the
 Google Books Library Project's digitization processes.
 The project has also undergone heavy criticism for things like copyright
 infringement as well as for promoting a type electronic colonialism (initially,
 the project only digitized western language books and magazines (predominately
 English) from a small set of US & European libraries.) However, since the
 program began, it has become much more inclusive of non-Western cultures.

 on the human experience, and preserving human culture by reversing the
 process of digitization, defamiliarizing the familiar, and reclaiming the
 physical/claiming the digital.

 When users first visit the site, they can enter a URL into a form which
 brings them to the CAPTCHA-fied HTML page for that URL.
 From this point on, any links clicked within the page will continue to
 be CAPTCHA-fied by the web server.
 However, as mentioned earlier in this paper, I have a strong aversion to
 showing digital works on a computer in a gallery setting.

 The familiar images had something slightly askew (the CAPTCHA-fied text)
 but their shape and size resembled that of a laptop screen, without the
 rest of the laptop.
 While it was a struggle to properly light the pieces due to the location
 (in a long hallway, the opposite wall being floor-to-ceiling windows),
 at night, with controlled lighting, the white acrylic backing would catch
 and diffuse the light, causing the floating screens to emanate a soft glow.
 The luminescence of the images under proper lighting conditions reinforced
 the connection to the screen.

It has been brought to my attention that web pages are primarily created
 for human consumption.
 However, the web pages we view and read are simply visual representations
 of the underlying code.
 The CAPTCHA-fication process is not simply replacing text with images on
 a web page, it fundamentally changes the underlying markup of the HTML
 pages in a way such that not only is the code itself is unreadable, but
 it's visual representation (or rendering) is as well.
 And it is done in such a way that it can no longer be deciphered by OCR
 processes.

 The block prints were created by etching a digital image into a linoleum
 block using a laser cutter.
 This created very crisp, pristine, and machine-like lines which contrasted
 well with the hand-made, DIY aesthetic.
 The inner pages were low-quality xerox copies, further reinforcing this
 conflicting man-made/machined aesthetic.
 As part of the installation, there was also a reading area consisting of
 two chairs and a footstool, where the pamphlets were displayed.
 There was originally a holder for the pamphlets to signal that they were
 takeaways, but it was not properly installed and shattered after falling

 The pamphlets were then arranged along the window behind the reading area.

The code to run the printer for the Serendipity Engine is very straightforward,
 but is not available online.
 A printer was dismantled until just the document tray, rollers, and motor
 were still intact.
 An arduino was connected to the printer's DC motor and was used to run
 the motor (and feed out sheets of paper) at standard time intervals, The
 prints were generated by another set of scripts using the node-captchafy
 library

, but this proved to be more overhead than necessary and the project was
 rewritten to use simple bash scripts.
 The scripts take a PDF file as input and run OCR algorithms on the document
 using the Tesseract library.
 Once Tesseract has identified the text in the PDF, the translation is saved
 in hOCR format, which is essentially an HTML document.
 Finally, this HTML document is processed by a custom PhantomJS script which
 positions and styles all of the elements accordingly and injects the node-captc
ha library in order to CAPTCHA-fy the whole page, replacing roughly ever
 other word on the page with a CAPTCHA-fied version of itself.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A CAPTCHA is something most Internet users have encountered, yet few know
 why they appear, and even fewer know how the process is connected to the
 digitization of physical books.
 However, based upon my interactions with students who visited the show,
 a fairly high proportion of them did know quite a bit more about the process.
 The goal for this project is not necessarily to educate or raise awareness
 about reCAPTCHA, but to get people thinking on a larger scale about how
 we digitize physical objects.
 What is the process of taking a scanned copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderlan
d and then being brought to a particular phrase in that digital representation
 after Google searching for a quote from the book? Why that book? Why books
 instead of other cultural objects, visual or non-visual? By making a

 Internet, and question the possibilities of how we interact with the digital,
 and what it means to view a digital document.
 Is a digital document simply a combination of zeros and ones? Or does it
 have structure from which information can be gathered and analyzed (by
 both humans and computer algorithms)?

 the two projects.
 Either they

 immediately, or after I explained it, they became very intrigued.
 There seemed to be a certain level of technical proficiency associated
 with the depth at which people connected with the pieces.
 There were a number of people who were incredibly excited by the ideas
 who seemed to have a very solid understanding of how software in general
 works, despite not necessarily being programmers (most simply worked with
 software and the Internet on a daily basis.) In this sense, I believe that
 my expectations of the primary audience being

Interaction with the pieces at the show was less than I had hoped.
 A few people interacted with Everybody's Google, but far less than I had
 expected.
 Part of this may be due to the fact that cell phone reception was not very
 good in the building.
 I decided not to set up a separate wifi network for the project despite
 it being inaccessible from cruznet (the standard university wifi) due to
 the website running on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 And the wall text (for both projects) did not overly emphasize the fact
 that these were software projects living on the web.
 Even with the addition of the web page URLs on the wall text, few people
 seemed to realize that these were both products or manifestations of software/w

CAPTCHA-fy! and the Serendipity Engine received mixed responses.
 Because of the limited available space in the printer mechanism and the
 long duration of the show, the Serendipity Engine only dispensed paper
 roughly ever eight minutes.
 I did not witness anybody remaining in the hallway area for more than eight
 minutes at a time, so it was in fact extremely serendipitous when a sheet
 fell from the ceiling and 
\emph on
was noticed
\emph default
 by a visitor.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reading area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over which it was installed was very simple and visually unassuming.
 I believe this was a large factor in why most people did not even seem
 to notice it.
 The pages from the Serendipity Engine did accumulate on the floor, but
 people tended to either ignore them, or thought that they had been knocked
 over, and stacked them together into a neat pile on top of the CAPTCHA-fy!
 booklets.
 This created two problems: first, the next time a page fell unnoticed to
 the ground, the next visitor would pick it up and place it on the now-stacked
 pile of previous pages; second, the pile was placed on the footstool, on
 top of the CAPTCHA-fy! booklets, essentially rendering them invisible.
 There were a series of booklets along the window sill, but without the
 context of a series of 4 or 5 clearly marked as

The pages from the Serendipity Engine and the CAPTCHA-fy! booklets were

While documenting, we timed the printer to dispense paper as people were
 walking by using a remote control and got great reactions.
 But again, it quickly devolved into people waving their hands at the ceiling,
 expecting a reaction from the magical printer in the ceiling.
 From this, I think it would've been important to have the piece be much
 more impactful rather than stressing its subtlety.
 People rarely noticed it - it may have been better to have it run for 10
 or 15 seconds straight over the course of an hour or so.
 Another option could have been to use a scroll as opposed to individual
 sheets to stress the intentionality of the piece.

 However, I often use the Internet as a medium as well, not simply in the

I have ideas which are compelling to me, and questions I try to grapple
 with.
 Software is a difficult thing to present in an (traditionally) aesthetically
 pleasing and approachable way.
 Perhaps code can have an aesthetic form, however, I'm not so much concerned
 with the code itself as much as I am with the processes and ideas the code
 represents.
 Although I have primarily produced software for these projects, code is
 not the only form in which I see these ideas manifesting.
 I'm more concerned with processes and systems than I am with objects, but
 social constructs inform us to focus on the isolated object of contemplation
 when inside a gallery.
 This is not the intension with the software I have written, but rather
 than fight those constructs, I've experimented with them and created physical
 objects and images for the MFA show.
 The goal was to condense the ideas into forms which could later expand
 and develop.

The Internet...is the first modern communications medium that expands its reach
 by decentralizing the capital structure of production and distribution
 of information, culture, and knowledge...
 This basic change in the material conditions of information and cultural
 production and distribution have substantial effects on how we come to
 know the world we occupy and the alternative courses of action open to
 us as individuals and as social actors.
 Through these effects, the emerging networked environment structures how
 we perceive and pursue core values in modern liberal societies.

 Public in the sense that the majority of sites do not have barriers to

 will become a method of data transport - whether it is the site & server

The media that carry segmented marketing messages, just like the ones that
 carry mass marketing messages, and even the marketing messages themselves,
 are socialization agents.
 Values, attitudes and lifestyles are learned from the content of communications
 media, whether those media are mass media or not...
 This means that the demassification of society may actually be a powerful
 reinforcement of social stratifications that could be hereditary and, because
 they would work through individual motivation, self-enforcing.

I believe that most of what we have seen up until recently has been analogous
 to the introduction of the printing press, or maybe the Kodak Brownie camera
 in the sense that it has achieved a massive leap in making certain types
 of content available on a mass scale.
 But How is this different from books & photography? Why is making it searchable
 and massively available different? It's not so much about that, but rather
 that the act of

Digitizing a physical artifact is not going to devalue the original, just
 as taking a photograph of a person does not steal their soul.
 One could argue that by making the digital representation widely accessible
 (through photos, 3D models, etc.) it could increase interest in the actual
 object and encourage people to visit it...? It is not much different from
 photo documentation or travelogues.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Code is law.
 If Google is our gateway to the world of the Internet, it’s laws and rules

 understanding of the space of the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is no “public space” on the Internet – everything is privatized public
 space.
 On the Internet, the gatekeepers of information are search engines, the
 most prominent being Google (as of July, 2011, Google was responsible for
 ~65% of all web searches – over 4x more than its nearest competitor.) However,
 search engines exploit the bidirectional communication inherent in web
 browsing to silently capture vast amounts of personal data and behavioral
 information from Internet users in order to “personalize” their web browsing
 experience.
 This personalization, in combination with the “black-boxed” ranking algorithms
 employed by these software systems have the ability to radically the informatio
n we encounter on the Internet.
 If we experience and know the world through our bodies, blah blah blah
 through Google.

.) However, as Google aims to provide more relevant information, its results
 are becoming personalized and

user-centric.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Today, when I search for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Google first takes everything it knows about me (and everything it 
\emph on
thinks
\emph default
 it knows about me) and uses this information to further refine its search
 results.
 And Google knows a lot about me.
 Some of the information I have explicitly given to Google while signing
 up for their services, such as my age & gender.
 But other information, Google has inferred by monitoring my browsing behaviour
 and making certain assumptions based upon how I access the internet (my
 geographic location, ISP, browser type.) They can tell if I've been waking
 up early on a regular basis and doing a lot of searches for gyms in my
 area - maybe I'm becoming more concerned about my health or getting into
 shape.
 It's safe to assume that Google has access to this information any time
 we preform a search, but Google also has access to our browsing behaviours
 across a large portion of the Internet, by providing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 analytics and advertising services to website owners.
 The website owners install these scripts inside of the HTML markup, and
 they get free ads and analytics software from Google.
 In exchange, Google gets access to the website users.
 And it can track individuals from page to page in order to create a more
 complex model of each Google user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Search personalization - Google is presenting a different view of the world
 to each individual user.
 This is used by *lots* of websites - Amazon markets specific items to users
 based upon voluntarily contributed demographic information (age, gender,
 location), but also infers much through users' behavoiurs.
 So, if you look at a lot of juicers, Amazon will make recommendations to
 you based on the assumption that you like making your own juice for various
 reasons - this then flows into other areas: books about juicing, seeds/gardenin
g products, health equipment, etc.
 Clearly, Amazon is trying to maximize its conversion rate, and sell as
 many products as possible.
 This is how they make money - each sale generates revenue for the company.
 Their product is sales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Google's product is information.
 Google places what it *thinks* are relevant to each user higher int he
 search results.
 This is based upon previous browsing history, search history, and web browsing
 behaviour.
 Each user can potentially be shown a very different set of results for
 the same search request.

As digital technologies become increasingly ubiquitous and accessible, digital
 resources are quickly becoming the primary resources for information and
 knowledge gathering.
 While the Internet is largely viewed as embracing democratic ideals and
 guaranteeing equal access for all, to all, the fact that our Internet experienc
e is mediated almost exclusively through privatized companies, is inherently
 undemocratic.
 In order to provide "relevant" information to individual users (and increase
 revenues), companies like Google and Amazon filter content and information
 through black box algorithms.
 End users have little to no control over which items or information are
 shown to them, or in what order; and because these algorithms are trade
 secrets, users also cannot have an understanding of the filtering and selection
 process.

Digitization

Many people rely on Google search to find information, and often-times the

 results (or now is often being integrated into Google's Knowledge Graph
 results.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Difference between web pages & traditional resources (TV, newspaper, magazine,
 radio) is that the web is always there, always available, yet is always
 changing.
 It is accessible, static, and yet extremely dynamic at the same time.
 Instead of merely consuming culture (TV, radio, film) we are now producing
 culture as well, thanks to the elimination of space-time made possible
 by high speed internet and wide accessibility to the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The digital and the physical are inherently intertwined.
 The digital largely consists of representations of physical objects, such
 as photographs, 3d models or environments, textbooks or journals.
 And the digital is only accessible through physical objects such as computers.
 And the Internet does not exist in some void - it is a massive infrastructure
 of wires, switches, and servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The digital makes the distribution and production on a massive scale almost

 Once a product is created, it can be copied over and over again, with no
 degradation of quality.

Webpages for Humans questions our notion of archiving and digital culture.
 Physical objects -> digital representations -> ? What happens to the digital
 representations.
 People forget about the physicality of the digital - web sites and data
 are transmitted over cables, applications are run from servers in warehouses
 full of servers (data farms.) When power goes down in silicon valley or
 a bomb is detonated at a server farm, what happens to not just our data,
 but our lives? As we come to live and experience more through the digital,
 having a single point of failure can drastically change blah blah blah.
 As we forget about the physical or replace/supplant it with digital representat
ions, how do we prepare for the inevitable evolution (of technology mediated
 communication) or disappearance of the current digital form?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Various extremes - experience everything digitally vs.
 eliminate all digital.
 But even somewhere in between (which is likely where we are /where we're

The Bible is by far the most-read book in the world.
 When searching for eBook versions of the bible, the three main resources
 for eBooks produce very different results, based upon price, and version
 of the bible: Project Gutenberg returns the King James Version as the top
 hit, Amazon returns the English Standard Version, and Google Play returns
 a different publisher's ESV.
 (Note, these are all free versions of the books as well - prices range
 from $1 - $10 for other digital copies of the Bible.) So why is this important?
 Not necessarily because books are dead and will be replaced by iPads and
 Kindles anytime soon (especially in the context of Churches AND especially
 given navigation difficulties in digital books as large as the Bible),
 but for people researching Biblical stories, these may likely be a highly
 valuable resource.
 But more importantly, these eBooks are the digital versions of the physical
 books.
 And this means they are being indexed, searched, and analyzed by various
 software services (search, language analysis/machine learning, sentiment
 analysis, etc.) Project Gutenberg makes the content available much more
 easily for machine consumption, and is much more easily accessible for
 humans as well.

Search & Algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Search engines are software.
 Their main algorithm is a function which filters information from a database.
 In Lev Manovich’s terms, the search engine is the narrative (the algorithm)
 through which we experience the world of the Internet (the database.) It
 is this algorithm which decides whether we are a radical anarchist, scholarly
 researcher, or a promising political candidate.
 But search engines are privatized so we cannot see the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Search engines constitute a powerful source of access and accessibility
 within the Web.
 [Previous research has shown] how access to the Web is preconfigured in
 subtle but politically important ways, resulting in exclusion of significant
 voices… The politics of search engines thus represents the broader struggle
 to sustain the democratic potential of traditional media, the Internet,
 and the World Wide Web in particular.
 (Introna and Nissenbaum 3-4)

This algorithm was written by a software engineer, or more likely a team
 of software engineers.
 I’m exploring the database of the Internet through their narrative.
 This is not my Internet, this is Google’s Internet, and therein lies one
 of the major problems.
 My experience of the Internet is filtered through privatized companies
 controlling the flow of information (search engines, ISPs, etc.) which already
 hints that the democratic potential of the World Wide Web has already been
 compromised.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Internet’s “information curators” are its search engines, and to a lesser
 extent, its aggregated news feeds and social networking sites (although
 I’ll later argue that the parallel to the library is the search engine,
 whereas news feeds and social networking fall more in line with entertainment
 and “infotainment.”) These systems (search engines, news aggregators, and
 social networks) filter through enormous amounts of data using computer
 algorithms designed to return “relevant” information to users.
 However in these privatized systems, the definition of “relevant” often
 exists in a gray area between “important” and “profitable.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Search engines and social networks generally support themselves by building
 network value in the Internet’s cognitive economy through link-clicks.
 In order to optimize profit potential, a search engine will return a fairly
 narrow set of results with the intent of maximizing link-clicks.
 This varies from the librarian who, given the benefit of conversational
 context, may optimize his/her “search results” to not only include the
 most relevant information, but also suggest tangential, yet related sources
 in addition.
 In order to replicate this ability, search engines must infer the context
 in which a query is being conducted without over-valuing what they think
 they know (personalization.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
With a trend towards information consumption through digital networks, it
 is algorithms such as these that will become increasingly responsible for
 the types of information imparted upon networked societies.
 Search personalization algorithms, news feed aggregation algorithms, etc.
 have the growing ability to impact the development of individual autonomy
 on a cultural and societal level.
 In the remainder of this paper, I will be investigating this idea by exploring
 how “black-boxed” software algorithms impact the plurality of and access
 to online information resources, and the effect of these on democratic
 society and moral autonomy in an increasingly networked age.

Newstweek by Julian Oliver & Danja Vasiliev Newstweek is a “tactical device

Google Alarm by Jamie Wilkinson Google Alarm is a web browser extension

Rationale (from original proposal)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I’m interested in exploring issues of transparency, autonomy, and agency
 with regards to technology, speciﬁcally the Internet or networked devices.
 As the power, aﬀordability, and ubiquity of digital technologies exponentially
 increases, so does the necessity to study the cultural impact of these
 systems.
 While most think of these technologies as things, I view them primarily
 as software and software systems.
 Without hardware to run on, software as we know it would not exist; yet
 without software, hardware (and the infrastructures required to build and
 run them) would be useless.
 We only experience the digital through software.
 While there are systems of policies, guidelines, and reviews of hardware
 technologies and infrastructures, only recently have software algorithms
 been seriously called into question, primarily due to monopolistic practices
 and unfair market inﬂuence[6].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The work for my MFA project largely focuses around Google, primarily because
 it is such a large part of my own personal Internet experience.
 I’m constantly connected to my Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Search not
 just on my computer, but also on my Android phone.
 I also route all of my phone calls through Google voice.
 I love the services Google provides, but sometimes it feels like Google
 knows me better than does my own mother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For a while now, Google has been a target of privacy advocate, scholars,
 and artists.
 At Transmediale 2010, F.A.T.
 lab initiated FuckGoogle, “a collection of 8 http://www.jasonmorrison.net/iakm/ci
ted/Bar-Ilan_Judit_comparing_rankings.pdf 5rowser add-ons, open source software,
 theoretical musings and direct actions aimed at creating an awareness of
 the role Google plays in our daily lives.” 9 .
 One of the notable projects to come out of this eﬀort was Jamie Wilkinson’s
 Google Alarm extension for Firefox 10 .
 Whenever personal information is sent to Google servers through tracking
 cookies, an alarm horn sound clip is played over the user’s computer speakers,
 transforming a normally silent intrusion of privacy into an extremely visceral
 and prominent event.
 The project also elucidates the omni-presence of Google - Google is constantly
 tracking individual behavior in order to personalize the web (and to serve
 hyper-targeted advertisements.) Google Views & Everybody’s Google attempt
 give power of personalization back to the user, and to create a story of
 the various life-worlds Google presents through its personalization algorithms.
 Personalization algorithms are important not just because of the curated
 information they present, but also because of the information which they
 omit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another related project is Newstweek 11 by Julian Oliver and Danja Vasiliev.
 Newstweek is a device which hijacks “Free WiFi” Hotspots by posing as the
 Hotspot’s router.
 It then allows the Newstweek administrator to transparently manipulate
 web page content from news sites before they reach a user’s web browser.
 While the target of these subversive attacks is news media rather than
 software algorithms, the project clearly demonstrates the necessity to
 just question the content itself or its sources, but also how it gets to
 your screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
With regards to the “performance” aspect of Everybody’s Google (users becoming
 actors in the story), there are two online pieces which I am reminded of:
 I’m Here and There 12 by Jonas Lund and KeyTweeter 13 by Kyle McDonald.
 Both of these break down the barrier between the private space of one’s
 home or oﬃce and the public space of the Internet by posting personal user
 interactions or activities directly to the web in real time.
 This creates a transparency of computer use, but also blurs the lines between
 public/private and real/virtual.

Web Pages for Humans addresses the codiﬁcation of culture.
 reCAPTCHA is a project (now run by Google) used to help “digitize” books,
 newspapers, and documents by exploiting human labour to decipher words
 which OCR algorithms are unable of “understanding.” These cultural artifacts
 are thus transformed into machine-readable ﬁles.
 Web Pages for Humans ﬂips this model around, taking machine-generated,
 machine-readable documents and manipulating them with the CAPTCHA distortion
 algorithms to ensure that computers can no longer read their own content.
 Taken a step further, the physical prints of Search Stories for Humans
 remove the digital representation, creating a format that can truly only
 be read by humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Aram Barthol did something related with his project Are you Human? 14 In
 essence, CAPTCHAs demonstrate the human intervention and cultural knowldge
 required to decipher signs of written language.
 By placing physical CAPTCHAs on walls heavily covered by graﬃti tags, Barthol
 is making a connection from the process of deciphering and interpretation
 of digital signs to the signs used in graﬃti culture.
 A graﬃti tag is a sign for tagger as well a a representation of the tagging
 process itself.
 Similarly, CAPTCHAs signify not so much the underlying meaning of the word
 depicted, but rather the processes of scanning, distorting, and deciphering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, Bicycle Built for Two Thousand 15 by Aaron Koblin and Daniel Massey
 is a great example of reintroducing the human element back into a computer’s
 representation culture.
 Users of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk recorded their interpretations sound
 clips from computer singing “Daisy Bell” (the ﬁrst song ever sung by a
 computer.) These samples were then combined together to reproduce the original
 track using human voices as opposed to computersynthesized sounds creating
 a human-ized version of a digital artifact.

Form (& evolution of projects)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
These projects deal with the internet.
 The internet is the content, and the internet is the medium.
 They take their form as websites, and equally important is the mindset
 in which someone encounters them.
 Ideally, a person encountering these projects would be coming from a google
 search, or perhaps had just filled out a CAPTCHA shortly beforehand.
 They are not meant to be contemplated or taken in isolation, they are meant
 to be integrated into/encountered during one's own (personal) internet
 experience.
